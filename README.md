# TripWire
“Trip-Wire” is a security system that users can use to monitor traffic moving through an area. 
The system uses a laser and a photonic sensor to detect movement through an area. 
The system not only alerts users of intruders, it also takes a picture of said intruder
and sends an email with the picture to the user. The system is not only cheap but it is also very portable,
and works in a variety of lighting conditions. So, it is perfect for users who are frequently on the move
and want a reliable security system.
