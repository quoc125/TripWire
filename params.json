  "body": "### TripWire\r\n“Trip-Wire” is a security system that users can use to monitor traffic moving through an area. The system uses a laser and a photonic sensor to detect movement through an area. The system not only alerts users of intruders, it also takes a picture of said intruder and sends an email with the picture to the user. The system is not only cheap but it is also very portable, and works in a variety of lighting conditions. So, it is perfect for users who are frequently on the move and want a reliable security system.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nQuoc Le(@quoc125), Brandon Royal, Sayeed Tahseen, and  Gilbert Vieux\r\n\r\n",
